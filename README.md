## Develop

This project uses a fairly standard [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) setup.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will install dependencies and open a local dev server at
<http://localhost:3000>.

Tweets are defined in [`./public/tweets.json`] which is generated by running
[twitter-pinned]. This file is automatically updated via a [scheduled GitHub
workflow][update-tweets.yml] that runs every 30 minutes (the list of users is
pulled from [`./public/users.json`] in the order they are defined).

[`./public/tweets.json`]: ./public/tweets.json
[`./public/users.json`]: ./public/users.json
[twitter-pinned]: https://github.com/walfie/twitter-pinned
[update-tweets.yml]: https://github.com/walfie/niji-en-pinned/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-tweets.yml

## Build

```sh
pnpm export
```

This will generate an optimized build in the `./out` directory, suitable for
uploading to a static file server.
